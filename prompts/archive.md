# Archived Implementation Details

## Error Handling (moved from main plan)

27. Create `src/features/multiplayer/services/conflict-resolver.ts` with ConflictResolver class for optimistic updates and conflict resolution strategies

28. Create `src/features/multiplayer/components/MultiplayerErrorBoundary.tsx` to catch and recover from multiplayer-specific errors

29. Test error handling works properly:
```bash
pnpm test && pnpm typecheck
```

These steps are deferred for a future, more complex implementation that handles edge cases and conflicts.
