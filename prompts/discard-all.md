Please create a new feature that allows the player to discard all cards in their hand and in play. 

I believe this will require a new function in services, a wrapper on the zustand store, and then a new button in the front end. Place the new button between the "Draw Hand" button and the "Show Deck Comp" button, call it "Discard All" and color it red.
